Some interesting points to take a look at, this file will bookmark them for this projects:

Some conversion tooling that exists for v3 jPDL -> v4 jPDL:

03.03.2010 - waiting a bit on this project to get oriented with reactions to my ideas (migration strategy) that I will be
             presenting to some developer organizations. I want to see how they respond.

21.10.2010 - team together, looking at code generated by previous member. jBPM5 alpha code examined and decided that due to 
             lack of maturity to start working on this tooling as follows: 

                - validate jPDL3 input file against jPDL3 XSD
                - transform jPDL3 to BPMN2 via XSLT
                - validate BPMN2 output file against BPMN2 XSD
                - at this point, up to the engine to run validated BPMN2 process def's!

             Updated existing project XSD's with BPMN2 found in the world (now they exist in a finalized form).
